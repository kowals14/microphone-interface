# USB Microphone Interface
This repository holds all the necessary files for Team 12's ECE 477 project.

## Project Description
USB Microphone Interface is a microphone interface intended to be used for USB microphones. This interface will receive the input from the microphone, and perform various kinds of DSP to the signal using a microcontroller, with additional physical inputs in the form of knobs in order to adjust any of their parameters. This will allow the user to fine tune various effects which they would like to apply in order to adapt to their relevant environment, microphone, as well as intended sound they would like to achieve. The interface will also contain UI on an LCD screen in order to help the user navigate the different effects and visualize the changes being applied to the signal, allowing the process to be more intuitive for users. The interface will be connected through a USB to a computer as its output, from which it will also receive its power from.
